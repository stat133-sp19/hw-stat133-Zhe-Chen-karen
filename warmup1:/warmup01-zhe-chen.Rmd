##Cooking Recipe
### mushroom tartines
#### ingredients
+ 2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter
+ 2 tablespoons (15 grams) all-purpose flour
+ 3/4 cup (175 ml) milk, ideally whole but lowfat should work
* A few gratings fresh nutmeg
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon (15 grams) smooth Dijon mustard
* 1/2 pounds (680 grams) fresh mushrooms (cremini, white or a mix of wild all work), thinly sliced
* Olive oil and butter as needed
* 2 teaspoons minced mixed fresh herbs such as rosemary, thyme and sage
* 1 pound loaf of a hearty white or whole wheat sourdough bread, in 3/4-inch slices
* 8 ounces (225 grams) coarsely grated gruyere or comte
* Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, to garnish

#### ???special??? kitchen tools
* oven
* skillet
* baking sheet

#### steps of the recipe
1. Make the sauce: In a large skillet (so you can use it again for the mushrooms), melt butter over medium heat and then stir in flour until a paste forms. Very slowly drizzle in milk, whisking the whole time to keep the mixture smooth. Add nutmeg, salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until mixture has simmered for a couple minutes. It will be thick and get thicker as it cools; this makes for a better spread. Scrape into a bowl and stir in Dijon. Adjust seasonings if needed. Set aside.
2. Heat oven: To 425 degrees F. Line your largest baking sheet with foil. Cook the mushrooms: Wipe out skillet and heat over medium-high. Add a glug of olive oil or a mix of olive oil and butter. Once it is very hot, add 1/3 to 1/2 of mushrooms, 1/3 to 1/2 of herbs and let sear in pan until brown underneath, about 2 to 3 minutes, before stirring and continuing to cook until tender and any liquid in the pan has cooked off, about 5 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining mushrooms.

3. Assemble and bake: Spread bread in one layer on prepared baking sheet. Schmear each all the way to the edges with sauce; you should have exactly enough for a thin coat on each. Heap each slice with mushrooms; use them all. Sprinkle cheese over and since the mushrooms are heaped so high, you???ll probably have to press it in a bit with your hand. You???ll be glad you got all the cheese on there.

4. Bake for 10 minutes, until cheese is melted all over, then transfer to the broiler and cook until tops are browned, a few minutes more (but keep an eye on it because broilers vary wildly and mine is rather weak).

5. To serve: Scatter with parsley and eat with a knife and fork, preferably with a big green salad on the side.

#### special season
It can be served year-round

#### variations of the recipe
If your bread is on the softer side, you might want to lightly pre-toast it before adding the other ingredients. However, if it???s already quite sturdy or has a dark crust, as mine did, it???s not needed. This makes an exactly-just-right amount of bechamel (3/4 cup), I use about 1 tablespoon per slice. If you???d like more, it can easily be scaled up with 3 tablespoons each butter and flour and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, and a heaped tablespoon of Dijon.

##Euclidean Distance
<font size=4> **Definition** </font>  [edit] \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the <font color=#0000FF>line segment</font> connecting them $( {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbf {p} \mathbf {q} }}} )$.

In <font color=#0000FF>Cartesian coordinates</font>, if $\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2},..., p_{n})$ and $\mathbf{q}= (q_{1}, q_{2},..., q_{n})$ are two points in <font color=#0000FF>Euclidean _n_-space</font>, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the <font color=#0000FF>Pythagorean formula:</font>
$$\begin{split} 
d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})
&=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2} \\
&=\sqrt{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(q_i-p_i)^2}.                                     
\end{split} \tag{1}
$$
The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a <font color=#0000FF>Euclidean vector</font>. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The <font color=#0000FF>**Euclidean norm**</font>, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }},$$
where the last expression involves the <font color=#0000FF>dot product</font>.
